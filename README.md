## What Is Kubernetes?  
Running a container on a laptop is relatively simple. Deploying and connecting containers across multiple hosts, scaling them, deploying applications without downtime, and service discovery among several aspects can be complex.  

Kubernetes addresses those challenges from the start with a set of primitives and a powerful open and extensible API. The ability to add new objects and operators allows easy customization for various production needs. The ability to add multiple schedulers and multiple API servers adds to this customization.
