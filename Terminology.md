## namespace  
A segregation of resources, upon which resource quotas and permissions can be applied. Kubernetes objects may be created in a namespace or cluster-scoped. Users can be limited by the object verbs allowed per namespace. Also the LimitRange admission controller constrains resource usage in that namespace. Two objects cannot have the same Name: value in the same namespace.  

## context  
A combination of user, cluster name and namespace. A convenient way to switch between combinations of permissions and restrictions. For example you may have a development cluster and a production cluster, or may be part of both the operations and architecture namespaces. This information is referenced from ~/.kube/config.  

## Resource Limits  
A way to limit the amount of resources consumed by a pod, or to request a minimum amount of resources reserved, but not necessarily consumed, by a pod. Limits can also be set per-namespaces, which have priority over those in the PodSpec.  

## Pod Security Policies  
Deprecated. Was a policy to limit the ability of pods to elevate permissions or modify the node upon which they are scheduled. This wide-ranging limitation may prevent a pod from operating properly. This was replaced with Pod Security Admission. Some have gone towards Open Policy Agent, or other tools instead.  

## Pod Security Admission  
A beta feature to restrict pod behavior in an easy-to-implement and easy-to-understand manner, applied at the namespace level when a pod is created. These will leverage three profiles: Privileged, Baseline, and Restricted policies.  

## Network Policies  
The ability to have an inside-the-cluster firewall. Ingress and Egress traffic can be limited according to namespaces and labels as well as typical network traffic characteristics.
